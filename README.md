# Jenkins Autoscaling Setup with AWS

## Overview

This guide covers the setup of Jenkins with AWS Autoscaling, Load Balancer, and EFS for Jenkins' data directory. 

## Objectives

- Implement **immutable infrastructure** using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Utilize tools like GitHub, Packer, Ansible, and Terraform.
- Deploy and manage resources on AWS, including IAM roles, EFS, Parameter Store, Autoscaling Groups, and an Application Load Balancer.

## Tools & Technologies

- **GitHub**: Version control for IaC.
- **Packer**: Build AMIs.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management.
- **Terraform**: Provisioning AWS resources.

## AWS Services

- **IAM Roles**: Define permissions.
- **EFS**: For persistent Jenkins data storage.
- **Parameter Store**: Manage SSH keys.
- **Autoscaling Groups**: Ensure high availability.
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic.

## Project Workflow

1. **Set up EFS**: Configure and mount EFS to Jenkins instances.
2. **Create SSH Keys**: Use Parameter Store for secure management.
3. **Build AMIs**: Packer builds AMIs using Ansible for configuration.
4. **Deploy with Terraform**: Provision AWS resources and manage infrastructure.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you will achieve a robust, scalable Jenkins environment on AWS, leveraging the best practices of IaC and automation.
